<h1> Transfer Learning Using TFHub</h1>
<h2> Transfer Learning on Quora Question analysis dataset using TensorFlow Hub </h2>
Transfer Learning is Machine Learning method where we reuse the pre-trained model as a strating point for a new task. Simply a model trained on one task is repurposed on a second, related task as an optimization that allows rapid progress when modeling the second task.
By applying transfer learning to a new task, one can achieve significantly higher performance than training with only a small amount of data.

We have dataset from Quora consists of various questions asked in quora, we need to find whether the question is <b>genuine / not spammed / relatable</b> for the new questions user want to upload.
So with the help of past data we need to extract the sentiment and make use of this trained model for future questions to maintain consitent questions in the platform.
